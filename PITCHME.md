* Coding standards
  * Lay them down, reference and use them
* Linting
* Name all your playbooks/tasks/roles
* Dont mix YAML & INI
* Directory structures
* DRY coding
* Always reference latest online documentation (things change)
* Be aware of your Ansible version
* Attempt to upgrade python to version 3
* Tags
* Split big playbooks - use ROLES !
* Staging code != Production code
* Plain text credentials !!! Use Vault
* Modules over command/shell
* Inline comments to help understanding - helps yourself as well as others
* Peer review
* KEEP IT SIMPLE
